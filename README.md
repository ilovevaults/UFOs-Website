# UFOs-Website
## Goals
The purpose of this project was to create a website using, CSS, JS, bootstrap and HTML that allows a user to look up UFO sightings all across the US in the year 2010.
There are currently five search filters and they are date,city,state,country,and the shape of the UFO.
### Summary
One drawback of this website is that the data is very limited because the range of the sightings only span from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. Another drawback is that in some of the descriptions for each sighting there are non-word characters which are distracting
Two recommendations to further the development of the website would be to add more data that can be searched so that there will be more variety and another suggestion would be to add links to other similar websites
