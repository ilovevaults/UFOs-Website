# UFOs-Website
## Goals
The goal was to create a website using, CSS, JS, bootstrap and HTML that allows a anybody to look up UFO sightings all across the US in the year 2010.
The original website did not have any filters but afterwards five filters were added and they were date,city,state,country,and the shape of the UFO. The user is able to use these filters to look up specific UFO sighting events by selecting a drop down box. CSS was used later on to improve the look and design of the website.
### Summary
One drawback of this website is that the data is very limited because the range of the sightings only span from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. Another drawback is that in some of the descriptions for each sighting there are non-word characters which are distracting
Two recommendations to further the development of the website would be to add more data that can be searched so that there will be more variety and another suggestion would be to add links to other similar websites
